"""The platform admin screen's API: every school, and a way to make another.

**For platform staff and nobody else.** A school's own administrator is staff of
*that school*; this lists every customer and makes new ones, which is the
platform operator's act (`create_school()` refuses anyone who is not platform
staff, and this asks first, before it reads a table). A refusal is a 403 with
one sentence and no detail about what the screen holds.

**On the portal host only**, like sign-in: the schools are rows in the shared
schema, and a school's host is scoped to that one school. Asked on a school's
host the route does not exist (404).

**Making a school is `schools.onboarding.create_school()`**, reused as it is, so
the screen and `manage.py create_school` cannot disagree about a subdomain, a
reserved name or a half-made school. That is seconds of DDL in a web request;
the rest of the platform keeps schema creation at a shell for that reason, and
this screen is the one exception, chosen by the operator. The response says what
happened to the invitation: emailed, or (no email address, or no email provider)
a link for the operator to hand over. The link is a credential and is returned
once, to platform staff, exactly as the command prints it once to a terminal.
