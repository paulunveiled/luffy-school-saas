"""The production configuration, tested as it is committed.

Every test here reads `deploy/production.env` — the file the server runs with —
and imports `settings.py` in a **separate process** under exactly that
environment, with nothing inherited from the shell running the tests. So what
these assert is the deployed configuration, not a value typed into a test: a
change to `production.env` or to the settings logic that derives from it is a
change these see.

Four claims, each the reason for a setting that would otherwise be easy to
"tidy" away:

1. **Connections are not pooled** (issue #115). Tenant isolation is Postgres
   `search_path`, which is per-connection state; a pooler in transaction mode
   would hand one school's `search_path` to another school's queries, silently.
2. **Behind the proxy, an HTTPS request is seen as HTTPS.** Without the proxy
   header the HTTPS redirect sends every request back to HTTPS for ever.
3. **The sign-in throttle counts the client, not the proxy.** Behind Caddy
   every request arrives from Caddy's address.
4. **`/healthz/` asks the database**, so a deploy onto a server that cannot
   reach Postgres is not waved through.
