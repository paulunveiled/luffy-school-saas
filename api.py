"""The HTTP surface: sign-in and staff invitations here, the gradebook in its own module.

`/api/login/` and `/api/logout/` are the door. Sign-in is unauthenticated by
definition and is served on the **portal host only** — see `_portal_only()` for
why that is a rule about which schools a login reaches rather than a routing
preference. Sign-out is authenticated, which is what puts it behind a CSRF
check.

The invitation endpoints are five, in two halves that differ in who is on the
other end.

The three `/api/schools/{slug}/...` routes are administrative and authenticated:
a signed-in person acting at a school they hold authority at. Authority is not
re-implemented here — `invitations.py` calls the same
`_require_grant_authority()` every other membership write goes through, so an
admin's reach stops at their own school in exactly the same way.

The two `/api/invitations/{token}/` routes are the opposite: the caller is not
signed in and by definition cannot be, because the whole point of the flow is
that they may not have a usable password yet. The token *is* the credential.
Both are therefore unauthenticated, both look their invitation up through
`Invitation.validate_token()`, and both answer a bad token with a flat 404 —
never "expired" versus "revoked" versus "no such thing", which would tell
somebody testing guessed tokens which of them were real.

`/api/gradebook/...` is mounted from `gradebook/api.py` rather than written out
below, and the split is the tenancy line rather than file length. Everything in
this file writes **shared** tables, which is why those paths name their school
in a `{slug}`: the school is a row and has to be identified. The gradebook is a
tenant app whose tables live in the school's own schema, already chosen from the
hostname by `TenantMainMiddleware` — so its paths carry no slug, and keeping the
two conventions in one file would invite a route that mixes them. That module's
docstring has the argument in full.

    write whose *response* was lost is a different situation, indistinguishable
    from this one at the browser and genuinely at risk of being applied twice.

    and only one of them is the one to send somebody to.

    ## Why the two booleans are computed here and not read off a role

    The landing draws a link per school, and what it needs to know is whether
    the surface behind that link will *serve this person* — not what they are
    called. Those differ, and the difference is the whole argument
    `docs/sign-in-page.md` made against shipping a link in the previous slice:

    - a bursar and a vice principal (academic) are staff and do not mark, so a
      register link keyed on "is staff" sends them to a 403; and
    - a PARENT membership with no `Guardianship` rows stands for nobody, so a
      `/cards/` link keyed on the role sends them to "No children on this
      account… ask the school office to add you as a guardian".

    So each boolean is the **same question the surface behind it asks**.
    `may_take_a_register` is `roles_at(school) & MARKING_ROLES`, which is what
    `attendance.services.can_mark_attendance()` is. `has_children_here` is
    `card_api._children_of()`'s predicate. Both are answerable from the public
    schema — `Membership` and `Guardianship` are in SHARED_APPS — which is why
    this is two set lookups rather than a query per school per boolean.

    Marking roles are read from `Membership` directly rather than by calling
    `roles_at()` once per school, which would be one query each. The filter is
    ACCESS_STATUSES for the same reason `roles_at()` is: an invited or
    suspended teacher holds a membership and no authority.

    **`user.schools()` is already ACCESS_STATUSES**, so a school reaching this
    list at all is one the person may act at; the booleans say what they may do
    *there*, which is a narrower question and sometimes "nothing yet".

    ## `parent_scoped` is what a six-digit code buys, said at the door

    `guardian_session()` calls this too, and a session opened with a code
    reaches "a parent-scoped read of their own children and nothing else" —
    `settings.GUARDIAN_SESSION_AGE` rests thirty days on that sentence and
    `User.roles_at()` is what makes it true on a school's host.

    It is **not** true here without being said. `roles_at()` narrows on
    `user.parent_scoped_credential`, which `SchoolAccessMiddleware` sets only on
    a school's host — and this route is portal-only, so the flag is False when
    this runs whichever way the roles are read. A guardian who also teaches
    would therefore have been told `may_take_a_register: true` on a credential
    that `can_mark_attendance()` will refuse the moment she uses it, which is
    precisely the link-to-a-page-that-refuses-you this field exists to prevent.

    So the caller says which door it is rather than this function guessing from
    a request it does not have. `has_children_here` is untouched by it: her own
    children are exactly what the code is *for*.
