# and every school's host (`deploy/Caddyfile`) and speaks plain HTTP to
# gunicorn on the compose network. `deploy/production.env` turns it on.
#
# **`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` is what makes the other two safe.** Without it
# Django sees every request as plain HTTP — because on its own socket it is —
# so the redirect below would send every HTTPS request back to HTTPS for ever,
# and CSRF's origin check would compare an `https://` Origin against an
# `http://` request and refuse every form and API write on the platform. It is

# Sessions
#

# each cell saves as it loses focus, so a marking session is a long stretch of
# steady small writes rather than one form and one submit.
#
# **The window is idle time, not total time.** Django's default,
# `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = False`, runs the clock from the moment of login
# and never extends it however hard the person is working. A teacher who signed
# in near the end of the window gets logged out mid-sheet, cursor still in a
# cell, having saved marks successfully seconds earlier. Sliding the expiry on
# every request is what makes "expired" mean "went away", which is the only
# meaning anybody expects.
#
# The cost is a session write per request, and with one request per blur that is
# thirty writes for one register rather than none. Accepted: the row is small and
# keyed by primary key, and the alternative is losing a teacher's work. If it
# ever shows up in the database's load, the fix is a cached session backend, not
# turning this back off.
#
# **Twelve hours, down from Django's two weeks.** A school day plus room either
# side, so a normal working day never trips it and a session left open on a
# shared staff-room computer is gone by the next morning. Two weeks of *idle*
# time on a machine several teachers use is a long time to leave a signed-in
# gradebook lying around; two weeks of idle time was never the intent, it was
# simply the default nobody had chosen.
#
# Not `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`: half of marking is done in a browser
# that is never deliberately closed, and it would put the teacher back where this
# started — logged out at a moment they did not choose.

# parent with children at three schools has one login, and
# `SchoolAccessMiddleware` re-derives what they may do from the host on every
# request rather than from anything stored in the session. Writing the school
# into the session would put the same fact in two places, and make the copy in
# the session the stale one the moment a membership is suspended.
#
# What that costs is this setting. Sign-in happens on the portal host (see
# `/api/login/`), and a cookie with no Domain attribute is returned only to the
# exact host that set it — so without a domain spanning the portal and every
# school, a teacher would sign in successfully on the portal and arrive at their
# own school's host as a stranger. Set it to the parent of every host the
# platform answers on, with a leading dot: `.luffy.school`.
#
# Left unset it is not merely unconfigured, it is wrong in a way that only shows
# up on the second host, which is why `accounts/checks.py` refuses a production
# deploy without it rather than letting it be discovered by a teacher. Unset is

# How long a phone channel may go unused before the guardian link is suspended,
# and how long a session opened by a one-time code lasts. The two are read
# together on purpose — see `accounts.checks`, which refuses a deployment where
# the session outlives the window.
#
# 180 days, phone only (docs/parent-access.md, D9). Nigerian operators churn a
# number after a total of 360 days of inactivity and reassign it, so finishing
# at 180 puts a school-mediated step in front of a reassignment while the number
# is still not even eligible for it. It never touches an active guardian: three
# terms a year means a natural sign-in roughly every four months, and the
# longest natural gap — the long vacation — is about two. Email is not churned
# and is not subject to it.
#
# Thirty days for the session, sliding (SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST). OPEN-4 asks
# how long is acceptable "on a device that may be shared or lost" and no school
# has answered; this is reasoning, not a school, and OPEN-4 records which. A
# guardian opens this a handful of times a term, so thirty days means checking
# in monthly never costs a second metered send, while a lost handset is exposed
# for at most a month.
#
# **The other half of that trade is what makes thirty days the number it is, and
# it is enforced rather than asserted.** What a code-opened session reaches is a
# parent-scoped read of that guardian's own children and nothing else:
# `SchoolAccessMiddleware` sets `parent_scoped_credential` on a session carrying
# `guardian_signin.OPENED_BY_CODE`, and `User.roles_at()` — the one call every
# guard on the platform makes — narrows to PARENT when it is set. A guardian who
# is also a bursar is an ordinary person rather than a corner case
# (`results.tests.test_withholding.TheClaimIsNotABool` is about exactly her); on
# this session she reads her own child's card as a parent rather than as staff
# the fee gate spares, and cannot hold a card back. She gets her staff powers
# again by signing in with her password.
#
# So raising this number lengthens a parent-scoped exposure. It does not lengthen
# a staff one, and that is the only reason thirty days is tolerable at all — the
# comment here said so for one commit before the code did, and said that it was

# Static files
#
# One server process serves the assets, through WhiteNoise, because this
# platform has no CDN and no separate web server in front of Django. The
# alternative is `runserver`'s static handler, which exists for development and
# says so.
#
# `STATIC_ROOT` is where `collectstatic` gathers them and the only directory
# WhiteNoise reads in production. It is deliberately outside the app tree, so a
# stale collected copy can never be mistaken for a source file.
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"

# **One project-level tree, and this reverses what this comment said a change
# ago.** The report card page's assets started per-app, under
# `results/static/results/card/`, on the argument that an asset belongs to the
# app whose page loads it the way its template does. Two pages broke that:
#
# 1. The sign-in page and the card page share `esc()`. Two copies of an HTML
#    escaper is two places to fix an XSS and one of them will be missed, which
#    is the drift this codebase spends its review effort removing.
# 2. Per-app static makes the URL space and the disk layout diverge — the
#    finders merge `results/static/` and `accounts/static/` into one `/static/`
#    — so a relative `import` that is correct in a browser resolves to nothing
#    on disk. That breaks `node --test`, which has no finders and reads files.
#    The page's premise is ES modules with no build step, and that premise only
#    holds while one relative path means the same thing in both places.
#
# So `static/` mirrors what is served: `static/web/` for what every page shares,
# `static/card/`, `static/signin/`, `static/index/` for each page's own.
# `STATICFILES_DIRS` is what makes that tree visible to the finders.

# ## The hashed manifest, and why it is off in development
#
# `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` renames every file to include a hash of
# its contents — `card.7f3c1e.js` — and rewrites `{% static %}` to match. That
# is what makes a far-future cache header safe: a changed file is a changed
# name, so no browser can hold yesterday's script against today's payload. It
# also pre-compresses, so the bytes on the wire are gzip/brotli without asking
# the CPU per request.
#
# It refuses to serve any file that is not in the manifest, and the manifest is
# written by `collectstatic` — which a test run and a `runserver` have not run.
# Under that storage `{% static %}` raises `ValueError: Missing staticfiles
# manifest entry` in development and in the test suite, and the failure looks
# like a broken template rather than an uncollected asset. So the manifest is
# conditioned on `DEBUG`: hashed and compressed where it is deployed, plain
# where nothing has collected anything.

#: answer in a second place, in a key that expires, and make a task's success
#: something the broker remembers rather than something the database does.
#:
#: Turning it on is a deployment's call — `flower` and any other tool that
#: watches task states needs one — and **the switch is the environment variable

CELERY_TASK_REJECT_ON_WORKER_LOST = True

#: The other half. Redis has no broker-side notion of an unacknowledged

#: default a parent waiting for a re-rendered card waits an hour, which is not
#: "another worker picks it up" in any sense a school would recognise. Five
#: minutes is longer than task 7's measured render by a wide margin and short
#: enough to be a retry rather than an outage.
#:
#: It must stay comfortably *above* the longest task runtime: a task still
