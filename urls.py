"""What a **school's own host** serves.

The API, and the report card page that calls it. In particular not the admin:
see `urls_public.py`, which is what the portal serves and where the admin now
lives.

The page is here rather than on the portal for the session cookie's sake: a
frame served from one host calling another is cross-site, and the cookie that
authenticates a parent would not be sent with the fetch. `results/views.py`
says the rest.

`django_tenants` picks between the two by schema. `ROOT_URLCONF` (this file) is
what a tenant host gets; `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF` replaces it on the public
schema, which is the portal. So "the admin is on the portal only" is enforced by
routing rather than by a check inside a view somebody could forget to add.
